# gensync

This module allows for developers to write common code that can share
implementation details, hiding whether an underlying request happens
synchronously or asynchronously. This is in contrast with many current Node
APIs which explicitly implement the same API twice, once with calls to
synchronous functions, and once with asynchronous functions.

Take for example `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`, if you're writing an API
that loads a file and then performs a synchronous operation on the data, it
can be frustrating to maintain two parallel functions.


## Example

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const gensync = require("gensync");

const readFile = gensync({
  sync: fs.readFileSync,
  errback: fs.readFile,
});

const myOperation = gensync(function* (filename) {
  const code = yield* readFile(filename, "utf8");

  return "// some custom prefix\n" + code;
});

// Load and add the prefix synchronously:
const result = myOperation.sync("./some-file.js");

// Load and add the prefix asynchronously with promises:
myOperation.async("./some-file.js").then(result => {

});

// Load and add the prefix asynchronously with promises:
myOperation.errback("./some-file.js", (err, result) => {

});
```

This could even be exposed as your official API by doing
```js
// Using the common 'Sync' suffix for sync
